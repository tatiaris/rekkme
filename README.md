## Problem ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Today, there is a _flood_ of online vendors, music content, streaming services, restaurants, books, travel destinations, and much more. How many of us scroll for hours through Netflix looking for something decent. Its hard to know what's good out there -- that's why peer-to-peer recommendations are so valuable! 

But recommendations are hard to keep track of: A friend can send you a song, but it gets lost in your text messages. You can screenshot your uncle's cool headphones, but it gets lost in your photos. What if there could be a central hub for all your recommendations? 

## Solution: Rekkme - The Hub for Recommendation & Exploration ‚úÖ

Rekkme is where to find all the good stuff without the clutter!

# Recommending is EXPLORING üîç

Rekkme is a social platform where users can find all the top recommended items. You can discover a new book or make a recommendation to a friend. All the top trending stuff is here!

All the recommendations sent by you AND sent to you are carefully stored... no more forgetting good TV shows to watch!

# Recommending is FUN üòÅ

Think your recommendations are good? Wager your REKK POINTS and put it to the test! If your friend is REKKED more than you expected you get more points... if not, well, you loss points but at least you tried. Earn more REKK POINTS to get on the Leader Board and even win prizes from our sponsors in the future!
